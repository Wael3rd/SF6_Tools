# SF6 Tools

A repository of some tools I made for Street Fighter 6.

To install, use FluffyQuack's mod manager at https://www.fluffyquack.com/, and RE Framework at https://github.com/praydog/REFramework-nightly/releases.

# Training Mode Tools

You need to download the 3 Training Mode lua so they can work properly.

There are 2 types of training modes
1. Hit Confirm
2. Reaction Drills

You need to add both fonts in \Steam\steamapps\common\Street Fighter 6\reframework\fonts

# Slots Managers

A tool to Export / Import as text files the recording slots in training mode
